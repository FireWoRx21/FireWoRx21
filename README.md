- 👋 Hi, I’m @FireWoRx21
- 👀 I’m interested in Fire Ecology, Spatial Analysis and Wildfire-Forestry Interactions. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning spatial analysis in R, developing new scripts to analyze fire behaviour. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving fire interaction with other values (i.e. forestry operations).
